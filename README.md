🎉 Get Ready for the Dart OOP Adventure! 🐍

You’re about to embark on an exciting coding journey! 🚀 With your Dart skills, you’ll dive into the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) while having a blast. Here’s what you’ll do:

Encapsulate Your Data: Create a class that protects its sensitive data with private variables and controlled access methods. It’s all about keeping your information safe! 🔒

Explore Inheritance: Implement a subclass that inherits properties and methods from a superclass. You’ll discover how to reuse and extend functionality like a pro! 🌳

Embrace Polymorphism: Show off your creativity by demonstrating method overriding, where different subclasses have unique implementations of a common method. Let your imagination run wild! 🎭

Master Abstraction: Design abstract classes and define abstract methods that your subclasses will implement. This will help you focus on high-level design! 🎨
